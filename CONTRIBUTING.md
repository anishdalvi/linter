## Contribution Points and Labels

We use a point system to reward contributions and also to determine who can work on particular issues.

#### Points System:

- Points for contributors are maintained in the `POINTS.md` file.
- Accumulate points by successfully closing issues and meeting the Acceptance Criteria.

#### Issue Labels:
- **L1 Issues**: These issues are good for first time contributors.
  - Only contributors with **less than 100 points** as per the `POINTS.md` file are eligible to work on L1 issues.
- **L2 Issues**: These issues are more challenging and require a certain level of experience with our project.
  - Only contributors with **more than or equal to 100 points** as per the `POINTS.md` file are eligible to work on L2 issues.
  
#### Want to work on an L2 issue?

1. First, check your points in the `POINTS.md` file.
2. If eligible, **comment** on the issue with the following format: `/attempt #[issue-id]`.  
   For example: `/attempt #123`.
3. **NOTE**: Failing to comment as specified, even if you provide a correct solution within the given time frame, will result in receiving only **half the points** for that issue.

### Submission and Point Allocation:

- If two or more contributors submit solutions for an issue that meets the Acceptance Criteria:
  1. The first contributor to submit will receive full points.
  2. Subsequent correct submissions will receive only half the points.

## Setup

Following are the steps to run the project locally:

1.  Go to preferred folder in your computer and paste the following command after forking our repository (Only one of it if you don't have ssh setup then go with HTTP command)

```
git clone https://github.com/<YOUR-USERNAME>/linter.git
```

2.  Navigate to the project folder

```
cd linter
```

3. Add a reference(remote) to the original repository.
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/dear-digital/linter.git
```

4. Check the remotes for this repository.
```
git remote -v
```
5. Always take a pull from the upstream repository to your master branch to keep it at par with the main project:
```
git pull upstream main
```

7.  Install dependencies

```bash
npm i 
```

7.  Now go ahead and create a new branch and move to the branch

```bash
git checkout -b <NAME-YOUR-BRANCH>
```

8.  To run Frontend and Backend concurrently
```

10.  After this go to your forked GitHub repository and go to `Pull Request` section. Now you might be able to see a pop up saying **Pull Request**. Click on the popup and you will be redirected to pull request page

11.  Now fill in the form template of the pull request and give the necessary description.
